The resize code contains two main parts: 'resize3.py' and 'test_resize.py'.
Firstly 'resize3.py' is the function of doing resizing, and when we do resizing, leave it intact.
And when we do resizing, we need to run 'test_resize.py'.
In 'test_resize.py', path1 (line 4) is the directory for the images under resizing.
And path2 (line 5) is the destination folder for the images have been resized.
Other things should not be changed.

Run: python test_resize.py
