- The weights file needs to be downloaded separately, too large for GitHub I think.


train1.py - trains from scrach
train2.py - loads weights for all layers except last dense layer (i.e. the output layer), progressively unfreezes layers and trains; need to decide how many layers back should be unfrozen
train3.py - loads weights for all convolutional layers and freezes convolutional layers, but randomly initializes weights for dense layers + trains them
