Notes

- The weights file needs to be downloaded separately, too large for GitHub I think. Not sure why my .gitignore isn't
    doing what I think it should be doing rn, gotta fix that.


train1.py - trains from scrach
train2.py - loads weights for all layers except last dense layer (i.e. the output layer), progressively unfreezes layers
    and trains; need to decide how many layers back should be unfrozen
train3.py - loads weights for all convolutional layers and freezes convolutional layers, but randomly initializes weights
    for dense layers + trains them
